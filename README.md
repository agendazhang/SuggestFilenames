## How to use the extension

1. When you need to download a file online, load this extension
2. Add new keywords that you want to use frequently in file names (e.g. a module code when downloading the modules' lecture notes)
3. If you have added certain keywords you need before, the extension will save them for you! You can call them back by selecting one or a set of keywords from the keywords box
4. You can also manually edit the final text box if you want to add few more letters from the keyword you selected (e.g. module code + '1')
5. Click on "Save To" to choose the directory to save the pdf file. The name of the file is same as the one in the final text box
# Inspiration
When we download a new file online, it is often tedious to key in all the words to rename the file. For example, if a student is downloading lecture notes of a module CS2040 and trying to rename each note as CS2040_1, CS2040_2, and so on, he or she always need to type ‘CS2040’ repeatedly.
# What it does
This chrome extension saves keywords that a user want to repeatedly use when renaming a file name. Going back to the previous example, a user can save ‘CS2040’ as a keyword in the popup window. Then, the user can use the keyword by clicking it from the keywords box in the popup window whenever renaming CS2040C lecture notes without typing out all the letters!
